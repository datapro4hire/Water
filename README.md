# Water Access Analysis
### Capstone Project - Data Science Diploma

Welcome! In here you will find details about my data science project. I will show you how I got started with the data, and how I implemented machime learning, and more!

### Introduction
In this project, I will analyze water quality across major Canadian rivers. Data was obtained from the Government of Canada's Open Data site.

### Background
Over the last few decades, water has become a scarce resource in many communities across Canada. The aim of this analysis is to identify stressors affecting acces to water.
My main goal is to help: 
    Corporations could optimize their consumption
    Non-profits could allocate resources to mitigate human impact
    Governments could plan infrastructure problems more efficiently
