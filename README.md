# Water Access Analysis
### Capstone Project - Data Science Diploma

Welcome! In here you will find details about my data science project. I will show you how I got started with the data, and how I implemented machine learning, and yes some cool AI stuff. Join me in this journey!

### Introduction
In this project, I will analyze water quality across major Canadian rivers. Data was obtained from the Government of Canada's Open Data site.

### Background
Over the last few decades, water has become a scarce resource in many communities across Canada. The aim of this analysis is to identify stressors affecting access to water and to predict water restrictions down the road. My ultimate goal is to help: 
* Corporations optimize their consumption
* Non-profits allocate resources to mitigate human impact
* Governments plan infrastructure problems more efficiently
