Note: The trend in water quality between the first year that data were reported for each site and 2017 was calculated at 175 sites across southern Canada. A uniform set of water quality guidelines and parameters were used through time at each site for the trend analysis. A Mann-Kendall test was used to assess whether there was a statistically-significant increasing or decreasing trend in the annual guideline deviation ratios at a site.,,
